# Awesome Firmware Security [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Awesome Firmware Security is a curated list of platform firmware resources, with a focus on security and testing. Created by [PreOS Security](https://preossec.com).

**_ObDisclaimer_**: Firmware is software. But, while you can wipe and reinstall software on your hard drive, it is possible to brick your system when working with the firmware. Use care, and proceed at your own risk.

**_NOTE_**: IoT / embedded operating system security is not included, unless they happen to overlap with platform security, such as Intel AMT, AMD PSP, Redfish, IPMI, BMC, OpenBMC. There are already awesome IoT/embedded operating system lists. eg: [Awesome IoT](https://github.com/HQarroum/awesome-iot)

* [ACPI](http://uefi.org/acpi/) - ACPI is a platform firmware technology, originally intended to replace Plug and Play, MP, and Advanced Power Management. The UEFI Forum owns the spec and maintains an awesome list of ACPI-related documents.
  * [ACPICA](https://acpica.org) - The ACPI Component Architecture Project (ACPICA) provides a reference implementation, and a collection of cross-platform ACPI tools, such as acpidump.
* [ARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_RISC_Computing) - ARC (Advanced Computing Environment) is a platform firmware technology used by early Windows NT non-Intel systems.

Intel has said that they will end-of-life BIOS-based platform firmware by 2020, replacing it with [UEFI](#uefi). Intel and a few IBVs have closed-source BIOS implementations. BIOS used to be the main firmware technology on Microsoft Windows PCs, until Windows started requiring [UEFI](#uefi).
  * [SeaBIOS](https://seabios.org) - The primary open source BIOS implementation.
* [coreboot](https://coreboot.org) - coreboot is a platform firmware technology, originally called LinuxBIOS. It loads payloads such as SeaBIOS, UEFI, among others. Widely used in embedded systems. Coreboot is used by Google on ChromeOS systems, using coreboot Verified Boot for additional security.

A card may need multiple drivers, one for each architecture and one for each platform firmware type (BIOS+x86_64, BIOS+ARM, UEFI+x86_64, UEFI+ARM, etc). Option ROMs do not account for all of the firmware on such a device, as the operating firmware for the device function such as RAID, or TCP offloading may be entirely separate.

* [UEFI DBX](https://www.uefi.org/revocationlistfile) - The UEFI DBX UEFI Secure Boot blacklist file contains the latest UEFI Secure Boot PKI blacklist/expired keys. Check your vendor documentation to see how your system's vendor tools work to obtain and apply this to your system; if the vendor has no tools, ask them to provide them.
